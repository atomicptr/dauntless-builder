## Localization

We're using Crowdin for managing localizations: https://crowdin.com/project/dauntless-builder

## Development Setup

Requirements:

-   Linux / MacOS / WSL v2+, regular Windows is unsupported
-   Node.js 18+ (Non LTS versions are unsupported)

```bash
# Assumption: You have already cloned the repository and are inside the directory
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Build dependency data (item data, i18n files, about page stuff, etc.)
$ npm run build:deps
# Run the development environment
$ npm run dev
```

You should now have Dauntless Builder running on your system via http://localhost:3000
(port might be different).

## Notes

### Data changes & the map file

If you change something in data/ make sure to call `npm run build:data` which will update .map/names.json
and include that in your pull request.

### English Language

Because Dauntless is developed by a Canadian company, we decided to use Canadian/British English instead of
American English.
